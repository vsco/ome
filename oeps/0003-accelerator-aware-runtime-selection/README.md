## Summary

This OEP introduces an AcceleratorClass abstraction to OME that enables intelligent runtime selection in heterogeneous GPU environments. Currently, supporting multiple GPU types (e.g., H100, A100, B200, H200) requires creating numerous runtime configurations - a combinatorial explosion that becomes unmanageable. The proposed solution provides a vendor-agnostic way to define accelerator capabilities and automatically match them with appropriate runtimes.

The design integrates seamlessly with existing Kubernetes ecosystem tools, particularly Kueue's ResourceFlavor concept, enabling users to leverage existing resource management infrastructure. By introducing capability-based matching rather than hard-coding specific GPU models, the system remains flexible and future-proof as new accelerator types emerge.

## Motivation

OME's current runtime selection mechanism matches runtimes based on model characteristics (format, architecture, size, quantization) but lacks awareness of the underlying hardware accelerators. In clusters with heterogeneous GPU types, this limitation forces operators to create and maintain separate runtime definitions for each GPU model - leading to operational complexity and configuration drift.

Furthermore, the lack of standardization across GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) in naming conventions and resource exposure makes it challenging to build a unified solution. Each vendor uses different labeling schemes, and Kubernetes device plugins expose resources differently (e.g., nvidia.com/gpu vs amd.com/gpu).

### Goals

1. **Reduce runtime proliferation** - Enable a single runtime definition to work across multiple GPU types
2. **Vendor-agnostic design** - Support NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and future accelerators without code changes
3. **Kueue integration** - Seamlessly work with existing Kueue ResourceFlavor deployments
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple for basic use cases, powerful for advanced scenarios
5. **Automatic optimization** - Select optimal GPU based on model requirements and availability
6. **Clear override hierarchy** - Provide predictable configuration precedence

### Non-Goals

1. **GPU virtualization** - This OEP does not address GPU sharing or MIG configuration
2. **Cost optimization** - While the design enables cost-aware scheduling, implementing cost models is out of scope
3. **Dynamic runtime generation** - Automatically creating new runtime configurations based on discovered GPUs
4. **Replacing existing APIs** - The design extends rather than replaces current runtime selection

## Proposal

Introduce new API resources and extensions to enable accelerator-aware runtime selection:

1. **AcceleratorClass** (Cluster-scoped) - Defines accelerator capabilities and discovery patterns
2. **Runtime/InferenceService extensions** - Add accelerator requirements and selection fields

Note: AcceleratorProfile was considered but deferred to reduce initial complexity. The same functionality can be achieved through InferenceService's acceleratorSelector field.

The system will automatically discover available accelerators, match them with runtime requirements, and select the optimal configuration based on model characteristics and user preferences.

### User Stories

#### Story 1: ML Practitioner Deploying Models

Alice wants to deploy a Llama 7B model for inference. She doesn't know the differences between GPU types and just wants her model to run efficiently.

**Current Experience:**
```yaml
# Alice deploys with auto-selected runtime
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: llama-7b
spec:
  model:
    name: llama-7b
  # Runtime is auto-selected based on model, but GPU type is not considered
  # Result: Might get scheduled on any available GPU (A100, H100, etc.)
  # Problem: No control over GPU selection, potentially inefficient resource use
```

**New Experience:**
```yaml
# Alice specifies only what she needs
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: llama-7b
spec:
  model:
    name: llama-7b
  runtime:
    name: sglang-universal  # Automatically selects appropriate GPU
```

#### Story 2: Platform Engineer Managing Multiple GPU Types

Bob manages a cluster with A100-40GB, A100-80GB, H100-80GB, and H200-96GB GPUs. He needs to support multiple model architectures without creating 16+ runtime configurations.

**Current Experience:**
```yaml
# Bob creates a runtime that works on all GPUs but can't optimize per GPU type
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: sglang-all-gpus
spec:
  supportedModelFormats:
    - name: safetensors
  containers:
  - name: sglang
    env:
    # Must use conservative settings that work on smallest GPU
    - name: GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION
      value: "0.85"  # Conservative for all GPUs
    - name: MAX_MODEL_LEN
      value: "16384" # Limited by smallest GPU
    # Can't enable H100-specific optimizations like FP8
```

**New Experience:**
```yaml
# Bob creates one universal runtime
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: sglang-universal
spec:
  supportedModelFormats:
    - name: safetensors
      autoSelect: true

        - name: GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION
          value: "0.90"
        - name: MAX_MODEL_LEN
          value: "16384"
      runner:
        args:
          - "--enable-prefix-caching"

    - selector:
        acceleratorClass: nvidia-h100-80gb
      env:
        - name: TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE
          value: "1"
        - name: ENABLE_FP8
          value: "true"
        - name: GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION
          value: "0.95"
        - name: MAX_MODEL_LEN
          value: "32768"
      runner:
        args:
          - "--enable-prefix-caching"
          - "--enable-chunked-prefill"
          - "--speculative-model=llama-68m"  # Enable speculative decoding
```

#### Story 3: Heavy Kueue User

Carol's organization uses Kueue extensively for resource management with ResourceFlavors already defined. She wants OME to leverage existing Kueue configuration.

**New Experience:**

    nodeSelector:
      topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "us-west-2a"  # Data locality requirement
      compliance: "pci"  # Compliance requirement
    # Final nodeSelector will be:

```

#### Story 5: Cost-Optimized Router Deployment

Emma wants to ensure routers run on cheap CPU nodes while engines run on GPU nodes.

**New Experience:**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: llama-7b-with-router
spec:

      instance-type: "spot"  # Use cheap spot instances
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "4Gi"
      limits:
        cpu: "4"
        memory: "8Gi"
        # No GPU resources specified

  # Engine configuration - GPU required
  engine:
    # AcceleratorClass nodeSelector will be merged here
    # But NOT applied to router
    acceleratorConfigurations:
      - selector:
          acceleratorClass: nvidia-a100-40gb
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1

  # Accelerator selection only affects engine/decoder
  acceleratorSelector:
    preferredClasses: ["nvidia-a100-40gb"]
```

#### Story 6: Cost-Optimized Model Serving

Frank wants to optimize costs by using A100s for small requests and H100s only for large requests that need the performance.

**New Experience:**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: sglang-cost-optimized
spec:
  supportedModelFormats:
    - name: safetensors
      autoSelect: true

          - requestSize: "<2048"  # Small requests prefer cheaper GPUs
      - class: nvidia-h100-80gb
        score: 100
        conditions:
          - modelSize: ">70B"
          - requestSize: ">4096"  # Large requests need H100 performance

  # Cost-optimized configurations per GPU
  acceleratorConfigurations:

          value: "32"  # Conservative batching
        - name: QUANTIZATION
          value: "awq"  # Use quantization to fit more on A100

    - selector:
        acceleratorClass: nvidia-h100-80gb
      env:
        - name: MAX_BATCH_SIZE
          value: "256"  # Aggressive batching for throughput
        - name: QUANTIZATION
          value: "fp8"  # Use H100's native FP8 support

---
# InferenceService can specify cost preference
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: cost-sensitive-deployment
spec:
  model:
    name: llama-13b

  acceleratorSelector:
    strategy: cost  # Prefer cost over performance
    annotations:
      ome.io/cost-threshold: "0.5"  # $/hour threshold
```

#### Story 7: Advanced Performance Optimization

Grace needs to deploy models with speculative decoding and advanced quantization techniques based on GPU capabilities.

**New Experience:**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: sglang-performance-optimized
spec:
  supportedModelFormats:
    - name: safetensors
      autoSelect: true

  acceleratorConfigurations:
    # A100 configuration - no speculative decoding due to memory constraints
    - selector:
        acceleratorClass: nvidia-a100-40gb
      env:
        - name: QUANTIZATION_METHOD
          value: "awq"  # 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
        - name: ENABLE_LORA
          value: "true"
        - name: KV_CACHE_DTYPE
          value: "fp16"
      runner:
        args:
          - "--enable-prefix-caching"
          - "--enable-cuda-graph"

    # H100 configuration - full optimization features

        - name: KV_CACHE_DTYPE
          value: "fp8"
      runner:
        args:
          - "--enable-prefix-caching"
          - "--enable-cuda-graph"
          - "--enable-chunked-prefill"
          - "--num-speculative-tokens=5"
          - "--spec-decoding-acceptance-method=typical"

    # H200 configuration - maximum performance
    - selector:

          value: "1"  # Single GPU has enough memory
        - name: MAX_MODEL_LEN
          value: "65536"  # Longer context with more memory
      runner:
        args:
          - "--enable-prefix-caching"
          - "--enable-cuda-graph"
          - "--enable-chunked-prefill"
          - "--num-speculative-tokens=7"
          - "--enable-flashinfer"  # H200 optimized kernels
```

#### Story 8: Custom Command with Accelerator Optimization

Henry has a complex sglang deployment with custom commands but wants GPU-specific optimizations to be applied.

**Scenario 1: User provides full command (accelerator args NOT applied)**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: custom-command-deployment
spec:
  engine:
    runner:
      # User has full control with command
      command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - >
          python3 -m sglang.launch_server
          --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
          --model-path ${MODEL_PATH}
          --tp-size 16
          --nccl-init $(LWS_LEADER_ADDRESS):5000
          --nnodes ${LWS_GROUP_SIZE}
          --node-rank ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX}
          --trust-remote-code
          --enable-torch-compile
          --torch-compile-max-bs 1
          --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1
          --enable-metrics
  # Even with acceleratorSelector, args from acceleratorConfigurations are NOT applied
  # because user specified command
  acceleratorSelector:
    preferredClasses: ["nvidia-h100-80gb"]
```

**Scenario 2: User provides args array (accelerator args are appended)**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: args-merge-deployment
spec:
  engine:
    runner:
      # User args
      args:
        - "--host=0.0.0.0"
        - "--port=8080"
        - "--model-path=${MODEL_PATH}"
        - "--tp-size=8"
        - "--trust-remote-code"

  runtime:
    name: sglang-performance-optimized

  acceleratorSelector:
    preferredClasses: ["nvidia-h100-80gb"]

  # Result: Final args will be:
  # ["--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8080", "--model-path=${MODEL_PATH}",
  #  "--tp-size=8", "--trust-remote-code",
  #  "--enable-prefix-caching", "--enable-cuda-graph",  # From acceleratorConfig
  #  "--enable-chunked-prefill", "--num-speculative-tokens=5",
  #  "--spec-decoding-acceptance-method=typical"]
```

**Scenario 3: Environment variable merging**
```yaml
apiVersion: ome.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: env-merge-deployment
spec:
  engine:
    runner:
      env:
        - name: TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE
          value: "4"  # User override
        - name: CUSTOM_SETTING
          value: "user-value"

  runtime:
    name: sglang-performance-optimized

  acceleratorSelector:
    preferredClasses: ["nvidia-h100-80gb"]

  # Result: Final env will include:
  # TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE=4 (user value wins)
  # CUSTOM_SETTING=user-value (user defined)
  # ENABLE_FP8=true (from acceleratorConfig, not overridden)
  # GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.95 (from acceleratorConfig)
```

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

1. **Kueue Integration:** When Kueue ResourceFlavors exist, OME can auto-discover and create corresponding AcceleratorClasses. This ensures consistency and reduces duplicate configuration.

2. **Vendor Differences:** Different GPU vendors expose resources differently (nvidia.com/gpu, amd.com/gpu). The AcceleratorClass abstraction handles these differences transparently.

3. **Override Precedence:** Configuration follows a clear hierarchy: ServingRuntime defaults → AcceleratorClass configurations → InferenceService spec → Pod annotations

4. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing InferenceServices continue to work. The new fields are optional and only enhance functionality when used.

5. **Interaction with Existing NodeSelector/Affinity:** Both ServingRuntime and InferenceService already have `nodeSelector` and `affinity` fields. The AcceleratorClass system works as follows:
   - AcceleratorClass defines the node selection criteria for specific GPU types
   - These are merged with existing nodeSelector/affinity settings
   - User-specified nodeSelector/affinity in InferenceService takes precedence

6. **Component Architecture:** OME uses separate Engine, Decoder, and Router components:
   - Engine and Decoder can have different AcceleratorClass selections
   - Router typically runs CPU-only and doesn't apply accelerator configurations
   - Components receive already-merged specs from the controller

7. **Container Args Merging:** Following OME's existing behavior:
   - Runtime args and user args are concatenated, not merged
   - Accelerator args are prepended to runtime args
   - If user specifies `command`, accelerator args are not applied
   - If user specifies `args`, they are appended after accelerator args
   - When an accelerator is selected, its nodeSelector is **merged** with existing nodeSelectors
   - Affinity rules are combined using AND logic
   - Direct nodeSelector/affinity in InferenceService takes precedence over AcceleratorClass
   - This allows users to further constrain placement beyond GPU type

6. **Router Component Handling:** The router component is CPU-only and doesn't require GPUs:
   - AcceleratorClass constraints are **only applied to Engine and Decoder** components
   - Router pods maintain their own independent nodeSelector/affinity settings
   - This prevents routers from being unnecessarily scheduled on expensive GPU nodes
   - Router can be explicitly scheduled on CPU-only nodes for cost optimization

7. **Container Arguments Merging:** When acceleratorConfigurations specify args and the user also provides command/args:
   - If user specifies `command`, accelerator args are **NOT applied** (user has full control)
   - If user specifies `args` as array, accelerator args are **appended**
   - Environment variables are **merged** (user values take precedence)
   - Resources are **merged** (max of user and accelerator values)

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1: Complexity for simple use cases**
- *Mitigation:* All new fields are optional. Users can continue using existing simple configurations.

**Risk 2: Conflict with Kueue ResourceFlavors**
- *Mitigation:* Provide automatic discovery and synchronization with Kueue ResourceFlavors. Allow bi-directional mapping.

**Risk 3: Performance overhead in selection**
- *Mitigation:* Cache accelerator discovery results. Use efficient matching algorithms.

**Risk 4: Vendor lock-in through capability definitions**
- *Mitigation:* Use generic capability names. Allow vendor-specific extensions without requiring them.

### Platform-Provided Base Set

Platform teams would typically provide a base set of AcceleratorClasses:

```yaml
# Simplified example for platform teams

### Auto-Discovery Examples

The platform could also auto-discover and create AcceleratorClasses:

```go
// Pseudo-code for auto-discovery controller
func (r *AcceleratorDiscoveryReconciler) discoverGPUs(ctx context.Context) error {
    nodes := &v1.NodeList{}
    if err := r.List(ctx, nodes); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    discoveredGPUs := make(map[string]*AcceleratorClassSpec)

    for _, node := range nodes.Items {
        // Check for NVIDIA GPUs
        if product, ok := node.Labels["nvidia.com/gpu.product"]; ok {
            if _, exists := discoveredGPUs[product]; !exists {
                spec := r.createNvidiaAcceleratorSpec(node.Labels)
                discoveredGPUs[product] = spec
            }
        }

        // Check for AMD GPUs
        if product, ok := node.Labels["amd.com/gpu.product"]; ok {
            if _, exists := discoveredGPUs[product]; !exists {
                spec := r.createAMDAcceleratorSpec(node.Labels)
                discoveredGPUs[product] = spec
            }
        }
    }

    // Create AcceleratorClass for each discovered GPU type
    for name, spec := range discoveredGPUs {
        ac := &AcceleratorClass{
            ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
                Name: sanitizeName(name),
                Labels: map[string]string{
                    "ome.io/auto-discovered": "true",
                },
            },
            Spec: *spec,
        }
        if err := r.Create(ctx, ac); err != nil && !errors.IsAlreadyExists(err) {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```

### Kueue Integration

The system provides bi-directional integration with Kueue ResourceFlavors:

```go

func (r *AcceleratorClassReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
    // Check if this is a Kueue ResourceFlavor
    if req.Namespace == "" && strings.HasPrefix(req.Name, "gpu-") {
        // Try to get corresponding ResourceFlavor
        rf := &kueuev1beta1.ResourceFlavor{}
        if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, rf); err == nil {
            // Create or update AcceleratorClass from ResourceFlavor
            return r.syncFromResourceFlavor(ctx, rf)
        }
    }

    // Normal AcceleratorClass reconciliation
    ac := &omev1beta1.AcceleratorClass{}
    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, ac); err != nil {
        return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)
    }

    // If linked to Kueue, ensure ResourceFlavor exists
    if ac.Spec.Integration != nil && ac.Spec.Integration.KueueResourceFlavor != "" {
        return r.ensureResourceFlavor(ctx, ac)
    }

    return r.updateAcceleratorStatus(ctx, ac)
}

// Auto-discovery of GPU capabilities from nodes
func (r *AcceleratorClassReconciler) discoverAcceleratorCapabilities(
    ctx context.Context,
    nodes []v1.Node,
) (*AcceleratorCapabilities, error) {
    capabilities := &AcceleratorCapabilities{
        Features: []string{},
    }

### Test Plan

#### Unit Tests

- `pkg/controller/acceleratorclass`: 2024-12-01 - 0% (new package)
  - Test AcceleratorClass CRUD operations
  - Test capability matching logic
  - Test Kueue ResourceFlavor synchronization

- `pkg/controller/inferenceservice/utils`: 2024-12-01 - Current coverage
  - Add tests for accelerator-aware runtime selection
  - Test override hierarchy
  - Test fallback behavior

- `pkg/apis/ome/v1beta1`: 2024-12-01 - Current coverage
  - Add validation tests for new API fields
  - Test defaulting behavior

#### Integration Tests

1. **Basic Accelerator Selection**
   - Deploy AcceleratorClass for different GPU types
   - Create InferenceService without accelerator preferences
   - Verify correct GPU selection based on model size

2. **Kueue Integration**
   - Create Kueue ResourceFlavor
   - Verify automatic AcceleratorClass creation
   - Test workload submission with accelerator requirements

3. **Override Behavior**
   - Test runtime default → service → annotation precedence
   - Verify each level correctly overrides previous

4. **Multi-GPU Scenarios**
   - Test tensor parallelism configuration
   - Verify correct GPU count selection for large models

5. **Failure Scenarios**
   - No matching accelerators available
   - Conflicting requirements
   - Invalid accelerator class references

### Deployment Strategies

Organizations can choose different approaches for managing AcceleratorClasses:

#### Option 1: Manual Management
- Platform team creates AcceleratorClass for each GPU type
- Full control over naming and capabilities
- Best for stable environments with known GPU types

#### Option 2: Auto-Discovery with Override
- Controller auto-discovers GPUs and creates basic AcceleratorClasses
- Platform team can override with custom definitions
- Balance between automation and control

#### Option 3: Template-Based
- Use Helm charts or Kustomize to generate AcceleratorClasses
- Parameterized templates for different GPU families
- Easy to maintain and update

```yaml
# Example Helm values for generating AcceleratorClasses
acceleratorClasses:
  nvidia:
    - model: a100
      memory: 40Gi
      variants: ["SXM4", "PCIE"]
    - model: a100
      memory: 80Gi
      variants: ["SXM4"]
    - model: h100
      memory: 80Gi
      variants: ["SXM5", "PCIE"]
  amd:
    - model: mi250x
      memory: 128Gi
```

### Graduation Criteria

**Alpha (v0.3):**
- Basic AcceleratorClass API implemented
- Runtime selection considers accelerator requirements
- Manual accelerator class creation required
- Feature gate: AcceleratorAwareScheduling

**Beta (v0.4):**
- Automatic discovery from GPU operators
- Kueue ResourceFlavor integration
- Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Feature gate enabled by default

**Stable (v0.5):**
- Production usage in 3+ organizations
- No API changes for 2 releases
- Performance optimization complete
- Migration guide from alpha/beta
- Feature gate removed

## Implementation History

- 2025-07-04: OEP proposed and discussed
- 2025-08-XX: Alpha implementation started
- 2025-10-XX: Beta release with Kueue integration
- 2025-12-XX: GA release

## Drawbacks

1. **Additional Complexity**: Introduces new APIs and concepts that users need to understand

2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires keeping accelerator definitions up-to-date as new GPU models are released

3. **Integration Complexity**: Supporting multiple ecosystem tools (Kueue, Volcano) adds complexity

4. **Migration Effort**: Existing users need to migrate to benefit from new features

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Extend ServingRuntime Directly

Instead of new APIs, add GPU requirements directly to ServingRuntime:

```yaml
spec:
  supportedGPUTypes: ["nvidia-a100", "nvidia-h100"]
  gpuConfigurations:
    nvidia-a100:
      env: [...]
```

**Rejected because:**
- Still leads to runtime proliferation
- No abstraction over vendor differences
- Difficult to integrate with Kueue

### Alternative 2: Node Selector Templates

Use templating in ServingRuntimes:

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelectorTemplate: |
    gpu-type: {{ .GPU_TYPE }}
    gpu-memory: {{ .GPU_MEMORY }}
```

**Rejected because:**
- Requires template processing infrastructure
- Less discoverable than explicit APIs
- Harder to validate

### Alternative 3: Rely on External Tools

Use Kueue or Volcano exclusively for GPU management:

**Rejected because:**
- Not all users have Kueue/Volcano
- Loses model-aware optimization opportunities
- Requires users to understand multiple systems

### Alternative 4: Dynamic Runtime Generation

Automatically generate runtimes based on discovered GPUs:

**Rejected because:**
- Can lead to runtime explosion
- Difficult to customize per-GPU optimizations
- Unpredictable behavior for users

The chosen approach balances flexibility, compatibility, and user experience while providing a clear path for future enhancements.
