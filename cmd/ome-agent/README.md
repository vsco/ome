# OME-Agent

OME-Agent is a robust, multi-functional tool designed to manage various tasks related to model inference and training in OME. Built in Golang, this command-line tool consolidates essential model management operations, such as replication, encryption, and decryption, into a single, easy-to-use “Swiss Army Knife” solution for OME operators.

## Features

OME-Agent offers the following capabilities:

1. **Model Replication from HuggingFace**
    - **Nested File Handling**: Downloads all files within a model, including subdirectory content.
    - **Multithreaded Downloads**: Accelerates large file downloads, especially those stored in Git LFS.
    - **Integrity Verification**: Confirms successful downloads by validating SHA256 checksums.
    - **Resume Interrupted Downloads**: Automatically resumes incomplete downloads.
    - **Smart Skipping**: Skips files that are already downloaded, saving time and bandwidth.
    - **HuggingFace Token Authentication**: Supports HuggingFace Access Tokens for restricted models and datasets.
    - **Branch-Specific Updates**: Tracks and updates files when switching branches.

2. **Object Storage Replication Between OCI Buckets**
    - **Cross-Bucket Replication**: Copies models between OCI buckets to support data redundancy and multi-region deployments.
    - **Region/Tenancy Support**: Allows model replication across OCI regions and tenancies.
    - **Configurable Concurrency**: Optimizes upload/download speeds through customizable concurrent connections.

3. **Model Weight Encryption and Decryption**
    - **OCI Vault Integration**: Uses OCI Vault and Key Management Service (KMS) for secure decryption of model weights.
    - **Advanced Encryption Standards**: Protects sensitive model data with encryption for regulated environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** version 1.23.0 or later.
- **Cloud CLI** and **SDK** for interacting with cloud storage services (optional if cloud services are not required).
- **HuggingFace Access Token** if downloading restricted models (optional if downloading public models).
- **OCI Vault and KMS** setup for model weight decryption (optional if not decrypting model weights).
- **Environment Variables**:
    - `GOPATH`: If not already set, select a directory and add it to the environment: `export GOPATH=...`.
    - `$GOPATH/bin` in `PATH`: Ensures tooling installed via `go get` functions correctly.
    - `GONOPROXY` and `GOPRIVATE`: (Optional) Set to retrieve dependencies from any internal repository.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the OME-Agent CLI.

```bash
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/sgl-project/ome
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/sgl-project/ome
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/ome.git
cd ome
make ome-agent
```

### Code Structure
OME-Agent follows a modular and scalable design, which makes it easy to extend with new features. The core structure relies on:
1.	[Cobra](https://cobra.dev/): For command-line interface (CLI) management, organizing tasks into distinct subcommands (hf-download, enigma, and replica).
2.	[Fx](https://uber.github.io/fx/): A dependency injection framework that manages the lifecycle of each component, injecting necessary dependencies and ensuring clean startup/shutdown of services.
3.	[Viper](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/viper): For configuration management, allowing settings to be loaded from a configuration file, environment variables, or command-line flags.

The main directory layout might look something like this:
```
ome/
├── cmd/                            # Contains subbinaries
│   └── ome-agent/                  # Contains Cobra subcommands

```

### Key Components Explained

#### Main Entry (main.go)
   The main.go file initializes the root Cobra command (ome-agent) and executes it. All subcommands are registered here using rootCmd.AddCommand. This file acts as the command dispatcher, directing commands like hf-download, enigma, and replica to their respective handlers.
### Command Files (hf_download.go, enigma.go, replica.go)
   Each subcommand file defines:
   - Command Metadata: Such as Use, Short, and Long descriptions.
   - Run Function: This is where the logic for each command begins. When a user invokes a command, the Run function creates an Fx application, passing along necessary dependencies and modules.
   - Flags: Each command can define its own flags (e.g., --config, --debug) to customize execution.

For example, in hf_download.go, the Run function invokes runHFDownload, which sets up and starts the HuggingFace Download Agent.

#### Config Provider (configProvider function)

The configProvider function is responsible for loading configurations into a Viper instance, which is then injected into the Fx app. It does the following:

1. Sets up default values and environment variable mappings.
2. Loads configurations from a file (specified by the --config flag).
3. Allows configurations to be overridden by environment variables.

Using Viper enables flexible configuration management, as it can support different deployment environments with minimal change.

#### Dependency Injection with Fx

Fx handles the orchestration of dependencies, lifecycle management, and dependency injection for OME-Agent. Each subcommand creates an Fx application with an fx.New() call that includes:

- Configuration: configProvider injects Viper with configurations for each agent.
- Modules: These represent the core functionalities and external dependencies, like:
  - Environment Management (env.Module): Manages environment variables and system-level configurations.
  - File System Abstraction (afero.Module): Provides a file abstraction layer for operations like file download, allowing for easier testing and extensibility.
  - Logging (logging.Module): Sets up logging using Zap, enabling structured logging across the application.
  - Secrets (keymanagement and secretretrieval): Manages interactions with OCI’s Vault and Key Management Service.

#### Main Application Module

Each subcommand has its own main application module, implemented as an Fx Option. For example:

- HuggingFace Download Agent (hf_download.Module): Handles the logic for downloading models from HuggingFace, validating checksums, resuming interrupted downloads, and managing access tokens.
- Replica Agent (replica.Module): Manages replication of model weights across OCI buckets, handling cross-region and cross-tenancy replication.
- Enigma Agent (enigma.Module): Manages encryption and decryption of model weights using OCI Vault and KMS.
- Training Agent (training_agent.Module): Manages the training sidecar initialization, which includes its config and client setup required to manage the training lifecycle.
Each module includes the main agent logic and is registered as a dependency in the fx.Options list for that subcommand.

#### Lifecycle Hooks

Each agent uses an Fx Lifecycle Hook to manage the OnStart and OnStop events. This ensures:

- OnStart: The agent starts and performs its primary function. For example, the HuggingFace Download Agent begins downloading the model files.
- OnStop: The agent shuts down gracefully when the CLI terminates.

#### Example code for managing lifecycle hooks:
```go
fx.Invoke(func(lc fx.Lifecycle, agent *hf_download.HFDownloadAgent, logger *zap.Logger, shutdown fx.Shutdowner) {
    lc.Append(fx.Hook{
        OnStart: func(context.Context) error {
            go func() {
                if err := agent.Start(); err != nil {
                    logger.Error("Error starting agent", zap.Error(err))
                }
                shutdown.Shutdown()
            }()
            return nil
        },
        OnStop: func(ctx context.Context) error {
            return nil
        },
    })
})
```
This hook architecture allows each agent to handle startup tasks asynchronously and exit cleanly, providing flexibility and stability during operation.


#### Adding New Commands
New functionality can be added by creating a new command using Cobra and integrating it with Fx as shown below:

 1.	Define a new command.
 2.	Set up dependencies and configuration.
 3.	Add the command to the main command tree.

Example:
```go
var cmdNewFeature = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "new-feature",
    Short: "Description of new feature",
    Run:   runNewFeature,
}

func init() {
    rootCmd.AddCommand(cmdNewFeature)
}
```
